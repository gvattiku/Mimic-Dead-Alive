The following questions are to create models for predicting in-hospital mortality for patients 65 years or older at the time of admission.

1.  Model that uses first 24 hours of data and predicts mortality any time (after 24 hours) during hospitalization.

2. Model that uses 24-hour sliding window to predict morality at any time during hospitalization. 

3. Model that predicts mortality within 24 hours at any arbitrary point. 

For models 2 and 3, create plots that shows how the predicted probability changes over time. This needs to be done for one patient at a time, so pick randomly 10 patients who died and 10 patients who did not die.
